<context>People are now getting murdered because of how they express themselves publicly</context>

<p>The concept of "freedom of speech" sounds good in concept. One should be able to say anything without fear of getting prosecuted for it. "They are just words" or "they don't know any better" or "they didn't mean it" or even "don't let it get to you" are some of the things adults used say to victims of bullying. But nowadays we know more than ever that words do hurt and there are definite consequences to how we choose to express ourselves to others. We must recognize that shootings and suicides are the tragically visible tip of the iceberg of a much bigger problem and that scapegoating or growing a backbone isn't the answer.</p>

<p>But there's a more underlying problem here as well. Making fun of people in the school yard is frowned upon but in adult life it somehow got accepted if not outright seen as a sign of strenght (especially in business and politics). Surely this is a confusing message to send.</p>

<p>Yes, adults are probably better equipped to handle insults (by having been exposed to them longer), but the fact is we don't walk our own talk and looking at society today, it shows.</p>

<p>What exactly is expected by "freedom"? Our justice system already shows there are a lot of things we cannot do, or rather, our justice system shows we are free to do anything, but there will be consequences to certain actions we are free to choose to take. The action of speaking or whatever other type of expression ought not to be any different. It's not a freedom, it's a privilege.</p>

<p>But like the justice system, figuring out what one can or shouldn't say, or what level of consequence there should be for a particular action is a bit of a gray area. It depends on context, past life events of the people involved, first or repeat offenses, and many other things that end up making our laws so complicated.</p>

<p>Yes, we need to have generally agreed upon terms in place for how to deal with people who cross the line, but in a way most of the responsibility should fall on ourselves. As caring human beings we should try to understand why we say the things we say and strive to say only what we really mean. This asks for a healthy dose of self-reflection, which is going to be hard given our busy lives, but it's a worthwhile attempt. There is a reason why the things we see in the world are happening. It's a direct consequence of our own actions (which includes the decision to take no action at all). And fortunately for us, we do have full control over that.</p>

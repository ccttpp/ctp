<p>It's been a crazy few years. We've witnessed the bankruptcy of big, global, believed-to-be-stable corporations. We've witnessed grave invasions of privacy of ordinary people. We've witnessed manufacturers and food processors cut so many corners that now both animals <em>and</em> humans are being treated unethically. We've witnessed the collapse of entire governments, leaving citizens vulnerable to violence and livelihoods and futures truly in jeopardy.</p>
<p>These types of extraordinary events happening in such a short timeframe is probably enough to make most people fearful of what may be yet to come.</p>
<p>We trusted our elected officials to do the right thing and serve the common long-term good rather than their short-term self-interest. We trusted the government to set the right policies and distribute wealth and equality. We trusted that there would be somebody to take care of us if we needed help. We thought our lives were stable; they were not. We're disappointed and we're discouraged.</p>
<p>There is no doubt these feelings are real and one is allowed to feel them, but let's face it: there is a lesson here for all of us to learn.</p>

<p>Did we truly believe the world machine would do what we think it should do and behave how we think it's right to behave, all without our direct involvement and, quite frankly, without the slightest bit of our care?</p>
<p>Were we <em>that</em> foolish to think that by taking a backseat in our world-life that the world would somehow turn out the way we expected it to? If you can read this then you will already have the life experience needed to know that taking on a passenger role hardly ever produces a satisfactory outcome.</p>

<p>So let's take some responsibility for what has occured and let's re-examine our involvement in the things that matter to us (in the things that--because of what has occured--we only now realize that they matter to us).</p>
<p>Do not take this involvement lightly. Having to face the facts is going to be tough. You will have to be honest with yourself. You will need to look at the world objectively, removing your own stake in or gain from a specific outcome. You'll have to do research--often lots of it and often about trivial things. You will need to learn the specifics of how things work or operate. You may need to open doors that are purposely kept closed to you. You will need to think about how things can be done differently. You will have to play out scenarios of how things might go to see how your newly shaped beliefs hold up under various circumstances. You will constantly need to sharpen your beliefs as you find out new facts, and you will need the ability to abandon certain parts or all of your beliefs if they don't hold up to what you find out to be the truth--your truth. You must be strong enough to stick to your truth once you have gathered sufficient proof of it and have honestly considered alternatives with an open mind.</p>
<p>This journey is certainly daunting but not unovercomeable. It wil be hard at first when you realize how much there is that you don't know. It will be hard to live an alternative lifestyle or believe in things that are not popular with the masses (or the mass media).</p>
<p>As you go through this journey, always remind yourself that you're learning because you lack knowledge. You no longer want to take things for granted or make decisions based on assumptions or hearsay. To make informed desicions, you have to be informed. Always remind yourself that ignorance is not bliss, that you are putting in this effort so you can live an authentic and <em>real</em> life. Know that all of your hard work <em>will</em> lead to transparency, accountability and better relationships. Not just in your daily life, but also in your worldly life.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to illustrate that things are not always as obvious as they seem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meat: you made sure the meat came from a sustainable farm. But where was the animal slaughtered? If not at the farm, it could have been sent to the same slaughterhouse where any other animal is processed, meaning it could have been put to death the exact same way as a non-sustainably raised animal with the same utensils and tools that just seconds ago processed a non-sustainable raised animal.</li>
<li>Everyday products: you made sure the products you buy are made in a country you like. But do you know where the raw materials used to make the product came from? Ask the company who makes the products. If they don't know ask them to find out or who you can talk to to find out. Then ask that this information is listed publicly. If the materials are imported, can you trust the country of origin has the right policies in place for public safety and good worker conditions? Think about how you would go about measuring this. Then find out how this is actually measured by the raw material producer(s), by the country the materials are imported to and by the company who buys and uses the raw materials. If you get the runaround, stop doing business with them. And while you're at it, call the parent company, if applicable, and see if you get the same answers.
<li>Food labeling: be aware that there are many alternative names for ingredients and that manufacturers may unknowingly or purposefully hide an unpopular or harmful ingredient under a different name. Find out who designed the food labels, in what order ingredients must be listed and what alternatives there are to food labels (e.g. mobile apps or Internet websites). If you get frustrated by how non-standardized this all is, work to address <em>that</em>.
<li>Organic food: find out what criteria food has to adhere to to receive the organic sticker. Do you agree with the criteria? Are there any common sense criteria missing? Is there money involved to get certified? Where does the money go? How do the various organic monitoring entities differ? Who runs them? While on the organic topic, also be aware that the wind may take pesticides sprayed on a neighboring crop to the organic farm. Look up the farm in your favorite online mapping application to check out the surrounding area, or better: visit the farm and form new relationships with the folks producing the food you consume.
</ul>
<p>The important thing is to not take someone else's word for it. Find things out for yourself. Demand that the people informing you (people you admire, the news media, politicians) provide resources and statistically relevant data. If they don't, make them aware that anyone should be able to verify claims made and/or absorb in greater detail the material behind those claims. If they refuse or can't or won't give you such references, don't just blindly believe what you hear. Find people and corporations that are transparent and support those instead. Practice what you preach and start providing references in your own communications (so learn to keep good notes). Feel free to start your own company. Feel free to start your own political party. You'll be surprised how much opportunity there is in the field of "do the right thing" (and how many people feel likewise but are just waiting for someone to take initiative). Be that person. Just be yourself, in the best way possible.</p>
